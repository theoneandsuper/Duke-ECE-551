========================================
For implementation, you earned 73.5 /  75.0
--------------------------------
Code quality was graded by: Haochen
Please ask them if you have any questions:
------------------------------------------
 * Makes good use of C library functions: Often (70-90%)
 * Functions are short: Often (70-90%)
 * Step 4 makes good re-use of step 3 code: Rarely (<40%)
 * Comments explain how things work where appropriate: Often (70-90%)
 * Functions have good names: N/A
 * Variables have good names: Always (>90%)
 * Line lengths are reasonable: Often (70-90%)
 * Indentation is proper: Often (70-90%)
 * Brace style is consistent: Always (>90%)
Your TA wrote the following comments:
Please consider making good use of library functions when parsing the input. Some of the functions are too long. Your step 4 logic contains duplicate code that is also used in step 3, and factoring out them into a separate function will help a lot on shortening those long functions. Some code lines are too long and there is a mixed usage of spaces and tabs for indentation, and more comments would be nice.

For quality, you earned 17 / 25 points
