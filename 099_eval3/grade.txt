Code quality was graded by: Tom
Your TA graded this based on use of C++11
Please ask them if you have any questions:
------------------------------------------
 * Classes are nouns: Always (>90%)
 * Methods are verbs: Always (>90%)
 * Good Use of Has-A: Always (>90%)
 * Good Use of IS-A: Often (70-90%)
 * Uses references (avoids needless copies): Always (>90%)
 * Rule of 5: Always (>90%)
 * Good use of public/private: Always (>90%)
 * const correct: Always (>90%)
 * Good use of STL (vector, set, map): Always (>90%)
 * Avoids Duplicating Code Between Container and Tanker: Some
 * Uses subtype polymorphism + dynamic dispatch (as opposed to if-else on type of ship): Yes
 * Step 4: Find fitting ship efficiently: Worse than O(N)
 * Find method is generic: No
Your TA wrote the following comments:
Good job!! The biggest area for improvement is Step 4: relying on preOrderDump and rebuilding the tree for every cargo item is inefficient. To get full points, implement a generic search inside the AVL tree class and maintain a persistent tree.

For quality, you earned 24 / 32 points
==================================================
