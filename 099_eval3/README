Before we begin, a word about C++11 vs C++03:
You may choose to use C++11, but if you do,
we expect you to use it *correctly*.  Correct use
of C++11 includes (but is not limited to):
    - Following the Rule of 5 instead of the Rule of 3
    - Use of std::move where appropriate
    - Correct use of noexcept specifications
    - Proper use of lambdas
    
Most students should be using C++03 as that is what we have done in
class. If you are using C++11, please change --std=gnu++03 to
--std=gnu++11 in your Makefile.

=====================================================
Second, please note that we will put *more* points
on quality (passing test cases will still be a major
portion of your grade), which will include correct use
of OO and data structures.  Each step will say
a little bit more about some of the things we will
be looking for in this regard.

Please note that if you choose to use C++11,
this OO grading will include correct use of C++11.

======================================================
Third, we *strongly* encourage you to start early.
We encourage starting early so strongly that we will
give you extra credit for intermediate deliverables
by certain dates:

  +2.5 points: By 11:59 PM on 11/17, pass the pregrader
  with these three lines in your testcases.txt file:

ships-step1 inputs/ships0.txt
ships-step1 inputs/ships1.txt
ships-step1 inputs/ships2.txt

   +2.5 points: By 11:59 PM on 11/24, pass the pregrader
   with this line in your testcases.txt file:
   
ships-step2 inputs/ships0.txt inputs/cargo0.txt

   +2.5 points: By 11:59 PM on 12/1, pass the pregrader
   with these four lines in your testcases.txt file:

ships-step3 inputs/ships0.txt inputs/cargo1.txt
ships-step3 inputs/ships1.txt inputs/cargo0.txt
ships-step3 inputs/ships1.txt inputs/cargo1.txt
ships-step3 inputs/ships2.txt inputs/cargo2.txt

   +2.5 points: By 11:59 PM on 12/4, pass the pregrader
   with these four lines in your testcases.txt file:

ships-step4 inputs/ships0.txt inputs/cargo1.txt
ships-step4 inputs/ships1.txt inputs/cargo0.txt
ships-step4 inputs/ships1.txt inputs/cargo1.txt
ships-step4 inputs/ships2.txt inputs/cargo2.txt


In total, this gives a possible 10 points of extra
credit, meaning you *could* score 110/100.

Please note that to receive this extra credit, the
pregrader *must* report you passed it.  Please look
for information like this at the end of your grade.txt:
**step1 basic tests passed for adh39 at 1730491784** : d5854ffd3e21f20dd7132f1a6ebfcf6226a183f6  -

You have PASSED all of your test cases
Keep adding test cases until you are satisfied your program is correct

Overall Grade: NO GRADE YET


Here, I have psased the intermediate checkpoints for steps1, 2, and 3
(but not 4).  Note that the 1730491784 is the time, and the hex
string at the end is a checksum which shows this line came from the
pregrader (you can't edit your grade.txt by hand to put this line
in because you can't compute the right checksum).

If you think that you should be passing the basic tests
for the extra credit, but are not, please look at the tests
and see if they say something like:

 *** This is one of the four cases for step 4 early start EC **

This can help you see if a test is counting right (if not,
make sure the line in testcases.txt is as above).  If
after checking this, you still have problems, please
talk to your professor.

======================================================
In this assignment, you are going to be writing a program control the
logistics of a shipping fleet.  In particular, your program will read
in a list of ships (with information about what they can carry, where
they are departing from, and where they are going to) and a list of
cargo (where it needs to go from/to, and information about its size
and characteristics).  Your program will then determine which cargo is
loaded onto what ship.

This assignment is divided into 4 steps:
  1. Read in ships and print total capacity on each route.
  2. Make one type of ship (Container), with the rules about
     what it can carry.  Read in a list of cargo and "load"
     it using the first available ship.
  3. Add more ship types (Tanker, Animal), with the rules
     about what they can carry
  4. Load the cargo into the ship whose remaining
     capacity is "Best fit" (meaning has sufficient
     space, but least extra space left over).

Note that a lot of the focus of this assignment is
on correct use of object-oriented programming.  Accordingly,
while functionality (does it pass test cases?) is a significant
portion of your grade, you will also be graded on how well
you use OO concepts.  In Step 4, you will be graded on making
*efficient* use of a Binary Search Tree to find the "best fit".

============================
Step 1: Print route capacity
============================
For this step, you will be reading an input file which describes the
"fleet" of ships you are loading cargo into. You can take a look
at inputs/ships0.txt or inputs/ships1.txt for examples of these input files.
The file has one ship per line, with the following format:

Name:Type info:Source:Destination:Total Capacity

Note that these fields are colon (:) separated.
Of these fields, Name, Type info, Source, and Destination are strings.
Total Capacity is an unsigned 64 bit integer.

For example,

The Majestic Dreadnought:Container,4,radioactive,explosive,toxic:Mordor:Sarth:1550

means the ship's name is "The Majestic Dreadnought", the information about
its type is "Container,4,radioactive,explosive,toxic", it source (where
it is sailing from) is "Mordor", its destination (where it is sailing to) is "Sarth",
and it has a total capacity of 1550 (you can imagine the units to be tons, or
megagrams, or whatever unit you want---the unit doesn't matter).

Note that *for this step* you do not need to do anything with the type information.
You do not even need to verify that the type information is valid---you can just
ignore that field of the input file.  It is here for later steps of the assignment.
However, when you use the pregrader, if your test case has invalid information
in this field, we will consider it an error (as our code covers all four steps).
Note that we will not test your step 1 code with invalid information in the
type information field.

What you do need to do in this phase is read in the ships and compute
the total capacity on each route.  You should put your main in step1.cpp,
and write whatever other cpp and hpp files you need.  You should put as little
code in step1.cpp as possible, so you can reuse your code effectively
for other steps (our implementation has less than 10 lines of code in step1.cpp).
We have provided a Makefile which will build each step.  If you were to run

./ships-step1 ships0.txt

you should get the following output:

(Gondor -> The Shire) has total capacity 1550
(Mordor -> Luthadel) has total capacity 2150
(Mordor -> Sarth) has total capacity 4550

The first line shows the total capacity for ships sailing from
Gondor to The Shire.  This particular route comes from
only 1 ship (The Misty Dreadnought).  The second line
shows the total capacity from Mordor to Luthadel, which
is the sum of The Majestic Kraken's capacity (650) plus
The Night Eagle's capacity (1500).  Likewise, the last
line is the sum of the remaining three ships in the input
file, as those ships are all sailing from Mordor to Sarth.

Every ship name must be unique: it is an error
to have two (or more) ships with the same name
(this is true in all steps).

The lines of output should be sorted by route (source
first, ties broken by destination).

If there are any errors in the input file, your program
should print an error message to std::cerr and exit(EXIT_FAILURE).

We have provided sample output in outputs/step1
You can see how we generated each of these files by
looking in outputs/list.txt

The following are some (but possibly not all) considerations
for OO design that you will be graded on:
   - Classes are nouns, methods are verbs
   - Good use of public + private
   - Good use of has-A relationships
   - const correctness of methods
   - Following the Rule of 3  (which includes not writing *any* R03 methods when none are needed)
   - Good use of STL data structures (don't reinvent the wheel)
   - Proper use of references

Note the TAs will only look at the final submission for these OO concerns,
so they won't see your step 1 code in isolation---you will have more
OO concerns later (which might affect this code), but these are things
you should be thinking about now.

As always, we recommend you test well, commit and push,
and make good use of the pregrader at the end of each phase.

As before, the pregrader will work by you providing "testcases.txt"
which contains one testcase per line with the program
to run and the arguments to give it.  We have provided
you a placeholder that has

ships-step1 inputs/ships0.txt

as an example/reminder of what to put there.

=========================
Step 2: Container ships
=========================
A quick note before starting this phase:  we encourage you to read
ahead to phase 3 before you write code.   Seeing what is coming might
help you design your code in this phase to have less work later.

In this phase, you are going to make use of the "type info"
field in the ship information, as well as read in the cargo
to load.

If we go back to the type info field from our example
in step 1:

Container,4,radioactive,explosive,toxic

The type information is comma separated, with the first
field being the type of ship.  In this step,
"Container" is the only value you need to be concerned
with.  Note that in step 3, there will be other
legal values ("Tanker" and "Animal").  We will
not test your step 2 code with "Tanker" or "Animal".
If you try the pregrader, it will accept these even
in step 2, as we reduce duplication of code by accepting
them.  Whether your final step2 code accepts them or
considers them an error does not matter, as we won't
test with them.

The remaining fields in the type inforamtion are specific to the type
of ship.  For a container ship, the next field (4 in this example) is
the number of "slots", which is an unsigned int.  This ship has space
for only 4 total pieces of cargo, even if its total capacity has not
been reached.

For a container ship, the remaining fields
(radioactive, explosive, and toxic in this example)
specify hazardous material capabilities for this ship.
This ship is equipped to safely carry materials
that are (any combination of) radioactive, explosive,
and/or toxic.  However, it cannot carry materials
with other hazardous material requirements (flammable,
corrosive,....)

Next, take a look at inputs/cargo0.txt.  This file
describes the cargo to be shipped.
The format is one piece of cargo per
line, with comma separated fields:

Name,Source,Destination,Weight,Properties

Name, Source, and Destination are strings.
Weight is an unsigned 64-bit integer.
Properties is 1 or more (comma separated) strings.

The first line of the file:

toy cars,Mordor,Sarth,20,container

Describes toy cars being shipped from Mordor to Sarth.
The weight is 20 (meaning it will use up 20 capacity
of the ship it is on).  There is only one property
(container) which determines which type(s) of ships
can carry this cargo (more on the rules below).

The next line is

fireworks,Mordor,Sarth,100,container,hazardous-explosive

Note that this line has two properties: container
and hazardous-explosive.  There may be many properties,
and they might be in any order.

Right now, our only ship type is Container, which
can carry a piece of cargo if ALL of the following
conditions are met:
   1. The ship must be on the proper route
      (if the cargo is going from X to Y,
       the ship must also be going from X to Y).
   2. The cargo has the "container" property
   3. The cargo ship has sufficient capacity
      remaining (total capacity - capacity of
      other cargo loaded so far >= weight of this cargo)
   4. The cargo ship has a "slot" open
      (the total number of slots for this ship >
       the number of pieces of cargo loaded so far)
   5. The cargo meets the "hazmat rules" (below)
      for this ship.

Hazmat rules (we spell these out separately,
as Tanker ships use them in Step 3).
   - Each ship has a set of hazardous material
     capabilities (which might be empty). For
     container ships, these are any fields
     in the type information after
     the number of slots
     (Container,slots,[zero or more hazardous material capabilities])
   - A piece of cargo may contain properties that
     state hazardous material requirements. Each such
     property starts with hazardous-
   - In order for a ship to be able to carry a piece
     of cargo, the ship must have ALL hazaradous material
     capabilities requested by the cargo.  For example,
     if a piece of cargo has
     hazardous-corrosive,hazardous-explosive,hazardous-radioactive
     then the ship with
     explosive,corrosive,radioactive,flammable
     could carry that cargo (the extra capability of flammable
     is not a problem).  However, a ship with
     corrosive,explosive
     could not (as it is missing radioactive).

With all of that in mind, your goal for this step is
to write a program (with main in step2.c) which takes
two command line arguments, a ships file (as
in step 1), and a cargo file (e.g., inputs/cargo0.txt).

The program should take each piece of cargo
(in the order listed in the file) and
  1. Find which ships COULD take the cargo
  2. Print
(number) ships can carry the (cargo name) from (source) to (destination)
  3 print out ALL ships which COULD take
     the cargo in alphabetical order
     by their names.  For each ship, you should
     print it one ship per line with 2 spaces
     then the name of the ship.
  2. Load the cargo onto the first ship
     from the list above
  3. Print out which ship the cargo
     was loaded onto, with a line of the format:
**Loading the cargo onto (ship name)**

For example, if run with inputs/ships0.txt
and inputs/cargo0.txt, the first piece of cargo (toy cars)
would result in the following output:

3 ships can carry the toy cars from Mordor to Sarth
  The Majestic Dreadnought
  The Shining Turtle
  The Swift Shark
**Loading the cargo onto The Majestic Dreadnought**

If there are no ships that can carry the cargo, you
should print a line with the format

No ships can carry the (cargo name) from (source) to (destination)

For example, when run with ships0.txt and inputs/cargo0.txt,
you should have this line in your output:

No ships can carry the rat poison from Mordor to Sarth

Note that such output is not an error, and the program should
continue processing the rest of the cargo.  Also note that it
is NOT an error to have cargo where there are no ships on
the requested route---you would print the "No ships can carry..."
line and continue.

After processing all the cargo, you should print

---Done Loading---Here are the ships---

then you should print the details of each ship,
in the order that the ships were read in from the input file.
The details of each ship vary based on the ships type,
but for a container ship (the only type we have so far),
you should print with this format:

The Container Ship The Majestic Dreadnought(320/1550) is carrying :
  toy cars(20)
  fireworks(100)
  radioactive waste(100)
  radioactive waste(100)
  (0) slots remain

The first line is

The [type of ship] Ship [name of ship] ([used capacity]/[total capacity]) is carrying:

Then one line per cargo, in the order they were loaded with two space,
followed by the name and then the weight in parenthesis.

The last line of the output is the number of slots remaining,
in this case there are 0, as The  Majestic Dreadnought has 4 slots,
and we have loaded 4 pieces of cargo.

As before, you can see sample outputs in outputs/step2/

A few comments on OO design:
   1. Continue to think about (and do a good job with)
      all the things we mentioned in Step 1
   2. Notice how the hazardous material rules are used
      by Tanker ships in Step 3.  Please avoid duplication
      of code (instead, make good use of OO ideas)
   3. Think about good use of is-A relationships
      and how to properly turn those into inheritance.

As always, we strongly encourage you to test well,
and make good use of the pregrader at the end of each step.

=========================
Step 3: More ship types
=========================
In this step, we are going to introduce two new ship types.
Your program will have the same overall behavior (in terms
of taking two command line arguments, printing the
ships that can handle each piece of cargo, loading
cargo onto the first elligible ship, and printing information
about each ship at the end).   The only difference
is that you will now support "Tanker" and "Animal" ship
types, with rules we will discuss below.

Before we dive into these rules, we will briefly note
that when I wrote this, I realized my step3.cpp would
be *exactly* the same as my step2.cpp.  Accordingly,
rather than copying, I just did

  ln -s step2.cpp step3.cpp

It is totally fine (but not required) for you to do this
if your step3.cpp would be the same.  We will also note
that needing no changes in main from step2 to step3 is
a good thing.

* Tanker Ships

If you look in inputs/ships1.txt, the third line is:

The Dawn Dreadnought:Tanker,-185,-150,25,flamable:Luthadel:Midgar:700

Here, the ship's type is Tanker, and there are three numbers
after it.  These are (in order)

min temperature (signed int)
max temperature (signed int)
number of tanks (unsigned int)

After these three numbers, any remaining fields are hazardous material
capabilities (following the same rules as hazardous materials for Container ships).

The min and max temperature define the temperature ranges that
this ship is capable of providing (in degrees C).   Cargo *can* have
properties that specify a minimum or maximum temperature that it can be transported.
These properties take the form of

mintemp=(num)
maxtemp=(num)

Where num is a signed int.
For example, we might have

milk,Mordor,Sarth,20,liquid,mintemp=1,maxtemp=10

which would specify that milk can be transported only if the ship is capable
of some temperature between 1 and 10 C.  A ship with a temperature range
of -20 to +40 would be acceptable (as SOME acceptable temperature for
milk is in this range).  However, a ship with a temperature range of
11 to 50 would not, as it cannot keep the milk cool enough.

It is totally legal for cargo to specify only one side of the range:

liquid hydrogen,Mordor,Sarth,200,liquid,maxtemp=-253,flamable

Note that all of these ranges are inclusive of both bounds, so a
ship that specifies a mintemp of -253 could carry the liquid
hydrogen (if all other conditions are met) because it could do
so at -253 degrees exactly.

Note that the above adds a new "feature" to cargo specifications:
some of the properties may now take the form name=value.
We make the following rules for these property specifications:
   1. At most one equals sign is allowed in any particular property,
      so  maxtemp=-253 is legal, but max=temp=-253 is not.
   2. Any property *may* have a value, even if it is not used.
      So you could write liquid=10, even if the value 10
      is not meaningful.
   3. If a value is omitted but is needed, treat it as
      if it were =0.  So if someone wrote 
water,Mordor,Sarth,200,liquid,mintemp

      it is not an error, but instead behaves as if they wrote
water,Mordor,Sarth,200,liquid,mintemp=0

    (Note: the combination of 2 + 3 are meant to simplify
     things for you: your code that parses properties
     does not need to know which properties expect values,
     it can simply treat all properties as having a value
     and provide a default value of 0 when one is not specified).

Note that it is NOT an error to describe impossible cargo

  water,Mordor,Sarth,200,liquid,mintemp=100,maxtemp=-200

is not an error, even though there is no valid temperature
range.

The other new piece of information in the Tanker ship is
the number of tanks.  The capacity is evenly divided between
the tanks (so total capacty = 700, tanks = 25 means a capacity
of 28 per tank).  It is an error if total capacity is not
a multiple of the number of tanks.

Only one type of cargo may go into a given tank.  For example,
if we have total capacity 100, and 4 tanks (25 capacity per tank).
If we load liquid hydrogen with weight=30, we would fill the
first tank, and the second tank would have 5/25 hydrogen in it.
If we then need to load 30 milk, we can't put milk and hydrogen
in the same tank, so we would have

25/25 hydrgen
5/25 hydrogen
25/25 milk
5/25 milk

At this point, the ship cannot handle a cargo of 25 milk,
even though it would be under its total capacity, as we cannot
put milk in the same tank as hydrogen.  However, we could load
20 milk resulting in our tanks being filled like this:

25/25 hydrgen
5/25 hydrogen
25/25 milk
25/25 milk

At this point, the ship could only take hydrogen (up to a total of 20 more).

Note that when loading a cargo of the same type as a previously loaded
cargo, any partially filled tanks of the same type should be filled
before using new tanks.

This means that the rules for a Tanker ship are:
   1. It must be on the right route
   2. It must follow the hazardous material rules
      (same as cargo ship)
   3. There must be sufficient total capacity remaining
      (same as cargo ships)
   4. The cargo must have either the property "liquid" or "gas"
   5. There must be sufficient tanks available to hold
      the material (as described above)
   6. The temperature range (if any) required by the cargo
      must include at least one temperature the ship can
      provide.

When printing Tanker ships (in the output at the end,
which says what each ship is holding), the output should
look like this:

The Tanker Ship The Gleaming Narwhal(14/500) is carrying : 
  propane(4)
  hot stuff(10)
  2 / 50 tanks used

Notice that the output looks much like a Container Ship's
output, except
  1. The ship type is Tanker
  2. Instead of the slots remaining, the number of tanks
     used is printed at the end (used / total tanks used)

* Animal ships

The last type of ships is Animal ships, which can carry animals.
They can also carry "small enough" other cargo (with certain rules).

The type information for an animal ship looks like this:

Animals,75

Note that there are *exactly* two fields (unlike Container
and Tanker, which can have many fields).   Animal ships
cannot carry ANY hazardous materials.  Instead,
the first field must be "Animals" (to specify
this type of ship).  The second field is an unsigned
integer which specifies what size of other cargo is
"small enough" that it can be carried on this ship.

Our animal ship follows the same basic rules as
other ships:
  1. It must be on the right route
  2. It must have sufficient capacity for the cargo

After that, if the cargo has property "animal" we
load it according to these rules:
   3. If the cargo does not have the property "roamer"
      we can load it
   4. If the cargo does have the property "roamer"
      and we have not loaded any other cargo with
      the properties "animal" and  "roamer". (This is an animal
      that needs space to roam around, and our
      ship only has one place for that to happen).

If the cargo does NOT have property "animal" then we can
load it if
   5. It does not have property "liquid" or "gas"
   6. It is not a hazardous material (no hazardous- properties)
   7. It is "small" meaning its weight is less than
      or equal to the "small enough" threshold specified
      in the ship's information.
    
The details of an Animal ship should print out like this:

The Animals Ship The Gleaming Eagle(50/140) is carrying : 
  caribou(50)
  has a roamer

Notice that this output is the same basic format as
the other ships. The differences are
   1. The type is Animals
   2. The last line is either
  has a roamer
OR
  does not have a roamer
      based on whether or not the ship has a roamer.

As before, you can see sample outputs in outputs/step3/

Note that for OO design in this step:
   - Follow all the things from before
   - Make good use of inheritance
   - Make good use of subtype polymorphism
   - Make good use of dynamic dispatch
   - Avoid duplication of code.

As always, we encourage you to test extensively
and make good use of the pregrader at the end of each step.

=========================
Step 4: Best fit loading
=========================

Up to now, you have been finding the list of elligible ships
and loading the cargo onto the ship from that list whose
name is alphabetically first.  You decide to try a different
strategy:

 - First, sort the cargo from largest to smallest.
 - Of all the ships that can take the cargo,
   load it onto the one that will have the least
   extra space leftover.
          - If there is still a tie (two ships
            with the same best capacity), break that
            tie by the alphabetically first ship name.

For sorting the cargo, you should break ties (equal capacity)
by keeping equal elements in the same order.  Note that sorting
algorithms which keep equal elements in the same order are
called "stable" sorts, and std::stable_sort will handle this
detail for you.

For finding the ship that can carry the cargo, but with
the least extra capacity leftover, you realize that
a balanced binary search tree is the perfect data structure!

As we don't cover balanced binary search trees, we have provided
one for you---don't worry, all the parts that are different from
a regular binary search tree are in the add and delete methods
which we have already written.  You can search this tree just
like you would any other BST.    The "AVL" part basically
just means that if you add 1, 2, 3 to the tree you get

     2                            1
   /   \            instead of     \
  1     3                           2
                                     \
                                      3

because the add method detects the imbalance and rotates
the tree (manipulating pointers) to get a shorter tree
and guarantee O(lg(N)) time on operations. 

We have provided

avlmultimap03.hpp   if you are using C++03 (most of you)
avlmultimap11.hpp   if you are using C++11

Whichever you pick, we provide

template<typename K,
         typename V,
         typename CompareK = std::less<K>,
         typename CompareV = std::less<V> >
class AVLMultiMap {
//a bunch of code
};

This class provides a map from K (key type) to a *set* of V (value type).
We provide you this class in particular so you can map from remaining capacity (uint64_t)
to a set of ships (whatever is appropriate in your code).   We also provide CompareK
and CompareV so that you can specify different orderings as needed (e.g.,
the set of values can be ordered by the ship's names if you want).  If you need
a refresher/example on how this sort of parameter works, refer to your "huff_tree"
assignment, where we provided class NodePtrCompare to specify how to order
things in the priority_queue with the third template parameter of std::priority_queue:

std::priority_queue<Node *,std::vector<Node*>,NodePtrCompare>

You will want to write a method that finds the *best* ship to carry a given cargo.
Recall that best means:
   - The ship can carry the cargo
       - Part of this is that the ship's remaining capacity is >= the cargo's weight
   - The ship's remaining capacity is the smallest of those which can carry the cargo
       (least extra capacity going to waste)
       - Ties of capacity are broken with alphabetical ordering of names
         (note that we map remaining capacity to a set of ships, so that all ships
          which tie on remaining capacity are in one set).

A few notes about this method:
   1. This method needs some way to check if a particular ship can carry a particular
      piece of cargo.  You *could* write a method that works only for Ships
      and Cargo.  Doing so is better than nothing (you will get functionality points),
      but you will lose some OO points.
      *Prefereable* is to make the method generic, so it works on any types of data
      that need to be filtered in anyways.

      * Students who are doing C++03 (most of you):
         -  You might think about templates as one approach to this problem.
            Remember that you can make a templated method inside a templated
            class (see the formative assignment "read_templ1" where MyClass
            is templated over T and its f function is also templated over A
            for an example of the syntax).   If you choose this approach,
            you might also look at how we use CompareK in AVLMultiMap.
         -  You might think about subtype polymorphism and dynamic dispatch
            as a possible approach to this problem.  If you take this approach,
            you might draw inspiration from how we handled Functions in
            the "binsrch" formative assignment.
         
      
       * Students who are doing C++11
        - If you are doing C++11, lambdas are the appropriate way to handle this.
          Note that the noexcept specification for this is a bit tricky, and is beyond what
          we expect you to know at this point, as we haven't covered std::declval.
          You won't get penalized for leaving noexcept off this function.
      
   2. This method should make good use of the binary tree's
      structure. You *could* use a brute force, approach to finding
      the appropriate ship by always examining every ship in the tree.
      Such an approach would get you functionality points, but would
      lose other points for inefficiency.  We will note that in the
      absolute worst case (the cargo has very small weight, but no
      ship is capable of carrying it), the best approach will still
      have O(N) behavior---as it will have to check every ship to rule
      it out.  However, a good approach should have O(lg(N)) behavior
      in most cases.  In particular, if the K best ships by remaining
      capacity are unable to carry the cargo, the algorithm should
      run in O(lg(N)+K) time.

   3. While we do not like casting in general, you might end up needing to cast
      because std::set's iterators give read only access to the data.
      That is, if you have
      for(std::set<V*>::iterator it = curr->vals.begin();
          it != curr->vals.end();
          ++it) {
        const V * data = *it; //must be const because *it give back const
        ...
      }
      We found we needed to cast away the const-ness (because we want
      to remove it from the tree, modify the remaining capacity, then re-add it), so
      this cast was appropriate:
      for(std::set<V*>::iterator it = curr->vals.begin();
          it != curr->vals.end();
          ++it) {
        V * data = const_cast<V*>(*it); //cast from const V* to V*
        ...
      }
      Note that if you do so, you must NOT modify the item while it is in
      the set (at least not in any way that matters for the set ordering)---which is
      why the iterator gives const values.   Best is remove from tree,
      modify, add to tree.
         - Note that the provided delete takes both a key and a value, as
           we we need the key to find the right set of values, then need to
           remove that value from the set.

Once you have done that, you should create step4.cpp and write
a main method. The program should take two command line arguments
(a ships file and a cargo file, as with steps 2 and 3). The output
format is slightly different, as we are not going to examine all
ships that can load a piece of cargo, instead, you will just print
which ship it was loaded onto (or that it couldn't be loaded) in
the first part of the output, with lines like this:

Loading radioactive waste onto The Majestic Kraken from Mordor to Luthadel 150 capacity remains
Loading cloth onto The Night Eagle from Mordor to Luthadel 1300 capacity remains

After loading all the cargo, you will print the same
---Done Loading---Here are the ships---
line as before, then the details of the ships (as before).

As with prior steps, you can see sample outputs in outputs/step4/

There are two major things beyond functionality you will
be graded on in this step:
   1. How generic your method to search the AVLMultiMap is
      (as discussed above)
   2. How efficient your method to search the AVLMultiMap is
      (as discussed above)
Of course, general concerns about design and good use of OO
will factor into your grade, as discussed in the previous steps.
