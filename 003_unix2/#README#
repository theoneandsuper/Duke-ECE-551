Now you are going to practice with a few other Unix commands.  If you can
here directly from the unix1 assignment (without quitting emacs), you will
see that the filename is README<003_unix2>.  That is because you have two files
named README open (which is fine), and Emacs puts the directory name in <>
to disambiguate them.

Before we proceed, let's close README<002_unix1>.
Hit C-x k.  Note the default is *this* buffer, which is not what you want to kill (close).
Instead, you want to type R[TAB] which should tab complete up to README<00  then type 1
and hit TAB again to TAB complete README<002_unix1>.  [Note: type a bit, TAB, type a bit
TAB is something you really want to get proficient at!]  Then hit Enter.

Notice that now the filename shown for this buffer is just README (its the only README
open).

Hopefully your window is still split to have the README at the top and *eshell* at the bottom.
If not,
   - If eshell is not running at all, run M-x eshell
   - If you need to split your window, C-x 2
   - If you need to change what buffer is displayed in a window C-x b

Remember that "C-x o" lets you switch between windows (e.g., README -> *eshell*)
If your eshell is still in the 002_unix1 directory, e.g., the prompt ends in 002_unix1 $
then you should use "cd" to change directories:

cd ../003_unix2

[Note: you can/should TAB complete!]

Remember that ../ is the parent directory (go up one level to where all your assignments
are) then 003_unix2 is in that.

Now we are going to run a few other commands that were not in your AoP reading, but
will give you some practice running commands.

First, we are going to practice using the "wget" command.  What is the wget command?
Remember that the man pages (short for manual pages) will tell you all about commands
and library functions.  Before we have you run "man wget", we want to remind you
that you can use "C-x b" to change buffers back to the README (we recommend
you get familiar with C-x b quickly).

So now, go to your *eshell* window (with C-x o) and run

man wget

Note that Eshell handles this specially and will bring the man page up in its own window in Emacs.
(Note that you can get a man page in Emacs directly with "M-x man" then typing the name of the man
page---you don't have to go through eshell for it).
After you do that use "C-x b" to switch back to the README.  At this point, you can use
"C-x o" to go up into the window that shows the wget manpage, so you can scroll around,
search, etc. Note that one of the nice things about viewing man pages in Emacs is that
you can use Emacs commands for movement and searching.

Let's start with what this does.  The top should say something like this:
---------------------------------
NAME
       Wget - The non-interactive network downloader.

SYNOPSIS
       wget [option]... [URL]...

DESCRIPTION
       GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from
       the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as
---------------------------------

In short, wget (which is short for World Wide Web Get) will download a file for you
off the internet.  Feel free to take a moment to scroll up down and look around.
Now, you want to run the wget command.   We need *eshell* back.  We'll note
that if we wanted to have the README, *eshell*, and *Man wget* all visible
at the same time, we could do so by splitting our window again.   We don't
really need this at the moment, but its good practice.  If your cursor
isn't already in the *Man wget* window, hit "C-x o" to get it there.
Now hit "C-x 3" to split the window verticlly.   You should now have
*Man wget* windows side by side (note that sometimes it is quite useful
to have two windows on the same buffer---e.g., to look at two parts
of your code at one time). In this case, however, we want to change
one of these *Man wget* windows to display *eshell*.  Use "C-x o" to
get to the on you want to switch to *eshell* (it will move circularly
through all windows) then do "C-x b".  If the default is *eshell*,
then just hit enter. Otherwsise *e[TAB] should tab complete what you need.

Now you can run use wget to download this file
wget https://adhilton.pratt.duke.edu/files/2024/example.txt

Remember: you can use Emacs key commands to copy and paste!
  - Go to the start of what you want to copy
  - Hit C-[space] (control space)
  - Hit C-e to go to the end of the line
  - Hit M-w to copy
  - Hit C-x o to go into the *eshell* buffer
  - Hit C-y to paste

wget should run and give you some output.  If you want to scroll
back up to see what it printed, you will find that the up arrow
goes back through your command history.  C-p (Control + p, p is
for previous) will scroll up and C-n (Control + n, n is for next)
will scroll down. 

Looking at this output, we find that its a bit cramped with the
side-by-side split with *Man wget*, and we are done with that
anyways.  Use "C-x o" to go into the *Man wget* window,
then "C-x 0" (note this is Control+x, then the number zero),
which gets rid of the current window.   Note the *Man wget*
buffer is still open, it just isn't visible (you could use
C-x k to kill the buffer if you wanted to).

Let's take a quick look at what we downloaded.  Go back
to *eshell* with C-x o, and do

cat example.txt

It will print out a few lines of text, which are the contents
of the file (not very excited, but just to practice with).

Now that you have some practice with wget, let's move on to another command.

The second command you will use "grep" (which stands for "global regular expression print").
We aren't going to delve into the intracacies of regular expressions, but instead
just search for a simple text pattern.  You are going to do this two different ways

First, run

/usr/bin/grep ndisce /usr/share/dict/words

Remember, you can copy and paste by
 - going to the start of that line
 - C-space to set the mark
 - C-e to go to the end of the line
 - M-w to copy
 - C-o to go into *eshell*
 - C-y to paste

What does this command do?  It runs the program /usr/bin/grep (note
that is an absolute path--we'll see why in a second) with two arguments

ndisce  : the pattern to search for
/usr/share/dict/words : the file to look in (the system dictionary)

Basically this is going to look through the dictionary for any line
with the pattern "ndisce". It should print out one word.

At the end of this assignment, you will write the line that
was printed out into a file called "answer.txt".

Now, we wouldn't usually run grep with an absolute path---its on
the system PATH, so normally we can just run it by "grep" instead
of the full path name. If you were to suspend emacs (C-z) and do

grep ndisce /usr/share/dict/words

you would get the same results (remember: you would resume Emacs with fg).

However, if you run

grep ndisce /usr/share/dict/words

in *eshell* you get slightly different results (before
you do it, remember C-x b changes buffers!)

In *eshell* it will just say
#<buffer *grep*>

but you will now have a *grep* buffer with a bunch of stuff in it.
Eshell has a built-in grep command that runs grep and displays
the results in a special buffer (with their line number first).
This behavior can be super helpful for large output sets
(where grep matched many lines)---as you can use emacs
commands to search them etc.


Another command that we are going to practice with is "diff".
This command shows the differences between two files,
and may be quite helpful to you on assignments where
we give you the expected output of running your program.
In such cases, you can use diff to find any differences
between your program's output and the file we gave you.

Lets start with the regular unix command diff:

Run this command in eshell (do you remember how
to copy/paste?)

/usr/bin/diff file1.txt file2.txt

You'l get output that looks like this:

2,4c2,3
< I love apples.
< Sometimes I eat bannanas too.
< Pears are great.
---
> I love cake.
> Sometimes I eat bananas too.
5a5
> Why did someone stick this line in here?


What on earth does that mean?
First lets take a look at the contents of these two files.
Go to your *eshell* buffer (with C-x o) and split
vertically (C-x 3).  In the current window, lets
open file1.txt with C-x C-f  (note this is
Control+x and the Control+f). Then you should
be prompted something like this (the course
number might be different depending on what
class you are in):

Find file: ~/gd510/dist/unix2/

Type file1.txt so it should say e.g.,

Find file: ~/gd510/dist/unix2/file1.txt

and hit enter.

Now you should see the contents of file1.txt
Now hit C-x o to the other window with *eshell*,
and open file2.txt (C-x C-f, then type file2.txt
and hit enter).

You can now see these files side by side.  The first
line is the same (Hello world!).  The second line
is different.  In file1.txt it says

I love apples.

in file2.txt it says

I love cake.

Now look at line 3. Are they the same?  It *looks* like it,
but bannanas/bananas are spelled differently.

file1.txt has a line (Pears are great) that file2.txt does not
have. The next line is the same.  Then file2.txt has a line
that file1.txt does not.    Now lets go back and look
at that diff output.

There are two different "hunks" of differences:

[Chunk 1]

2,4c2,3
< I love apples.
< Sometimes I eat bannanas too.
< Pears are great.
---
> I love cake.
> Sometimes I eat bananas too.

[Chunk 2]

5a5
> Why did someone stick this line in here?

In both of these chunks, < means "this was in the first
file (file1.txt)" and > means "this was in the second
file (file2.txt)".  Diff (by default) only reports
the differences---not the same lines.

The 2,4c2,3 is the "hunk header" in this case,
it is saying that it shows lines 2 through 4
of the first file, which changed (c), and lines
2 thourgh 3 of the second file.  

After that, we see the changes
< I love apples.
< Sometimes I eat bannanas too.
< Pears are great.
---
> I love cake.
> Sometimes I eat bananas too.

The first three say "these are the lines that
were in the first file here" (<) and the ---
separates those from the second files (>).

The second hunk has an "a" in the header (added),
and shows just the one line that was added to the
second file (not in the first).

Note that sometimes subtle differences might be
harder to spot---bannanas vs bananas might
look the same as you look over the diff output.

Let's instead use Eshell's integration to show the
diff output in Emacs.  First if you still have
three windows open, lets get rid of one.  Go
to file2.txt and do C-x 0 (control+x then zero).
Now go to file1.txt and do C-x b *eshell*.
Hopefully you have just the README and *eshell* now.
Before the next command, remember that if you need
to get back to the README, you can use "C-x b" to change
what buffer is in a window, and "C-x o" to change what
window you are in.  Now run:

diff file1.txt file2.txt

Note that in *eshell* this will run Eshell's integration
with diff (at a "regular" command prompt you would
just get the plain diff, and don't need to specify the
absolute path).

Now you have some very different output---with a bunch
of colors!  First, note that the first line
tells us what command it ran.  You can see
that Eshell added -u.  What does this mean?
You could do M-x man diff and search (C-s)
for -u.  But I'll just tell you: it gives
up to 3 lines of context for the differences.
That is, it gives up to 3 that are
the same between the files before and after
the changes to help you understand where they
are.

Next, the output list the files that got diffed
and their timestamps.  The fourth line is
the chunk header, which is formatted differently
(because of -u). The - and + here indicate
which files (- is the left, + is the right).
The 1,7 says "lines 1 through 7"---so here,
both files are showing lines 1 through 7.
Next we have teh differences.
The first line starts with a space (meaning no
difference---it is part of the context). Notice
that emacs colored it in "regular" font.

After that, there are lines that start with a -
there were in the first file but not the second
(minus because they were removed if we are thinking
about how we got from the first to the second).
These lines have a red background.... but some
parts are more of a light pink. If you look closely,
the light pink parts are what changed between the lines.
For example:

I love apples.
     to
I love cake.

Has "apples" in light pink because that's what
in particular changed on that line.

Later we see lines with a + (in the second
file but not the first).  These have a green
background. As with the "removed" lines,
there is a lighter green for the specific changes
(apples->cake).

Notice that this coloring scheme not only makes it
easier to see the difference in "bannanas" vs "bananas"
but also shows us that one of those lines has an
extra space at the end!

Now that you have the hang of diff, lets use it to find
the difference in a big file.  The file

/usr/local/ece551/unix2/w.txt

is almost but not quite like

/usr/share/dict/words

I have made one change in it.  Use diff
to find the change with

diff /usr/share/dict/words /usr/local/ece551/unix2/w.txt

Once you have done that, open a file called "answer.txt"
(C-x C-f answer.txt) and write two lines (each one
word) in it.  The first line should be the word
that

grep ndisce /usr/share/dict/words

showed you.  The second line should be the word
from /usr/share/dict/words that has other stuff
written on its line in /usr/local/ece551/unix2/w.txt

Once you have written these two words into answer.txt,
you should save it (C-x C-s). Once the file is saved,
go to *eshell* and run

git add example.txt answer.txt
git commit -m "Did unix2 assignment"
git push
